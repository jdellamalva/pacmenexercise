# PacMan exercise

This was a simple js demo exercise that saw us practice using constructor functions to add pacmen to the screen, then use SetTimeout recursively to update their position. Pretty neat stuff.

## Roadmap

I've been working on following a code tutorial to build the original Pacman arcade game including complex AI logic for the ghosts. That's next on the docket for this project, whenever I circle back to it.
